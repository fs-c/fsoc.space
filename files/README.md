This repository is home to a number of completely unrelated branches. I know this isn't good practice but all of them worked well with the repository name, and only one of them is currently active.

- [`archive`](https://github.com/fs-c/files/tree/archive) (default, you're here), an archive of files, also browsable via [fsoc.space/files](https://fsoc.space/files)
- [`directory-listing`](https://github.com/fs-c/files/tree/directory-listing), a simple NodeJS CLI tool that recursively generates directory listings in HTML format, this used to generate the HTML on [fsoc.space/files](https://fsoc.space/files)
- [`file-upload`](https://github.com/fs-c/files/tree/file-upload), code for a file-hosting service which I ran in 2017-2018 on [fsoc.space/files](https://fsoc.space/files)
