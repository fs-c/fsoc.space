This is the `workbench` branch of the repository where all changes happen. The [`master`](https://github.com/LW2904/fsoc.space/tree/master) branch is hosted through GitHub Pages on [fsoc.space](https://fsoc.space) and updated on every push to this branch.

You will want to clone this repository with `git clone --depth 1 ...` or `git clone --single-branch ...` because otherwise you will also pull in the master branch, which is huge.
