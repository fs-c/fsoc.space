This is the `workbench` branch of the repository where all changes happen. The [`master`](https://github.com/LW2904/fsoc.space/tree/master) branch is hosted through GitHub Pages on [fsoc.space](https://fsoc.space) and updated on every push to this branch.

Trying to minimize fluff by using [fs-c/dhow](https://github.com/fs-c/dhow) for site generation and a lightweight custom [markdown parser](https://github.com/fs-c/smdp).
